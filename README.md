# cfn-iam-groups-users-roles

> Cloudformation templates that create a hierarchical set of groups, users and roles for use in a stand-alone AWS development account. A distinction is made between Console Users and Programmatic Users. A default password is supplied to Console Users and Secret Access Keys are generated for Programmatic Users. The Console Administrator Account is created within the Root Account and the hierarchical collection of groups and users is then created within that Console Administrator Account.
